Open Addressing
Like separate chaining, open addressing is a method for handling collisions. In Open Addressing, 
all elements are stored in the hash table itself. So at any point, size of the table must be 
greater than or equal to the total number of keys (Note that we can increase table size by copying old data if needed).

Insert(k): Keep probing until an empty slot is found. Once an empty slot is found, insert k.
